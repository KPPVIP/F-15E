Before you use this, make sure to use the CWeaponInfoBlob Limit Adjuster by alexguirre to prevent the game from crashing during loading:

Instructions [Add-On]:

1. Place the "f15e" folder into [Gamefolder]\update\X64\dlcpacks\

2. With OpenIV, extract [Game folder]\update\update.rpf\common\data\dlclist.xml and edit this with Notepad++. Add the following entry:
		<Item>dlcpacks:\f15e\</Item>

3. Now you are done, you will need a trainer with "spawn by name" function (Enhanced Native Trainer for example) to spawn the vehicle type in:

"f15e"



Mod/tuning options:
Front bumper: flipped cockpit mirrors (only visual)
Rear Bumper: Working Laser (make sure to have the weapons of Arena War DLC in your inventory for proper effects)
Spoiler: Switches cluster bombs to long range missiles
Exhaust: Changes nozzles from idle to afterburner (only visual)
Chassis: Changes the bomb layout (only visual)
Roof: Changes the fuel tank layout (only visual)


If you're game crashes on startup, download a custom gameconfig.xml for your update.rpf. Example: https://www.gta5-mods.com/misc/gta-5-gameconfig-300-cars

I would advise using a Mods folder (more info at OpenIV) 
and make a backup, I take no responsibility if any shit happens.
